# VR_APP

An example how to use Google VR SDK to show 360Â° images and videos.

The sample uses two fragments that display an embedded panoramic image and a video using VrPanoramaView and VrVideoView, respectively. They allow the user to view different parts of the panorama by rotating their phone. The simplevideowidget sample also allows the user to pause and play their video by tapping on the VR View, and seek through the video using the slider. The samples expose the fullscreen mode and Cardboard mode buttons in the VR View which allow the user to change modes. This app describes how to get started using the Google VR for Android SDK by building and running one of our sample apps on your Android device.

The app which demonstrate the VR View functionality in the SDK. I recommend using a phone with gyroscope.
